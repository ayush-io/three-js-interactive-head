Use Chrome for animations to load. 
To see the project, 
simply, just open the index.html file in your browser. Chrome is suggested for animations to load. If the 3D model doesn't load, open this folder in a code editor like VS Code after that start a live server. 
I tried using react for the project, but couldn't got the same output since i wasnt in touch with react from a long time. Will master it soon.
